## Introduction

WorkWise is an innovative application designed to connect employers, employees, and freelance workers on a single platform. Whether you are looking to hire talented professionals or seeking new job opportunities, WorkWise simplifies the process by providing a user-friendly interface and robust features.

It is built using *Ruby, React, bootstrap css, node js and HTML.*

## Minimum Viable Product

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of WorkWise will include the following key features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can sign up with their email or social media accounts and log in securely to access the platform.

2. **User Profiles:** Users can create and customize their profiles, including personal information, work experience, skills, and portfolio (for freelancers).

3. **Job Listings:** Employers can post job openings with detailed descriptions, requirements, and application deadlines.

4. **Job Search:** Job seekers can search for jobs based on various criteria such as location, job type, and skills required.

5. **Apply for Jobs:** Users can apply for job opportunities directly through the platform, and employers can review and manage incoming applications.

## Problem Statement

The traditional job search process can be time-consuming and inefficient for both employers and job seekers. It often involves multiple platforms, lack of real-time communication, and difficulties in finding the right fit.

Some of the common problems in the current job market include:

1. **Fragmented Platforms:** Job postings are scattered across various websites, making it hard for employers to find suitable candidates and for job seekers to discover relevant opportunities.

2. **Ineffective Communication:** Traditional email-based communication between employers and candidates can be slow and lead to missed opportunities.

3. **Lack of Information:** Job seekers often struggle to find comprehensive information about potential employers, hindering their decision-making process.

4. **Trust and Credibility:** The absence of a reliable rating system makes it challenging for both employers and freelance workers to gauge the credibility of each other.

## Solution

WorkWise aims to address these challenges and provide an all-in-one platform for linking employers, employees, and freelance workers. The proposed solutions are as follows:

1. **Centralized Platform:** WorkWise will serve as a centralized platform for all job-related activities, allowing employers and job seekers to find each other efficiently.

2. **Real-time Communication:** The integrated messaging system will facilitate direct and real-time communication between employers and candidates.

3. **Comprehensive User Profiles:** Users will have detailed profiles showcasing their experience, skills, and portfolio, providing valuable insights into their qualifications.

## Problems Encountered

Some of the problems encountered during development of the project are problems hosting the backend and although all backend functions were tested using **[Postman](https://postman.com)** and all work, not all were applied to the frontend due to errors encountered mainly because of having a separate backend and frontend. Development is still ongoing and all these shall be solved soon.

The problems main solutions lie in the use of a better way to integrate the backend and frontend by use of *Ruby on rails*
